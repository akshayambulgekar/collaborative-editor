# Collaborative Document Editor Architecture

## Overview
A web application for real-time collaborative document editing with basic AI suggestions.

## Architecture
- **Backend**: Flask with Flask-SocketIO for WebSocket support, PostgreSQL for data storage.
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript with Socket.IO client for real-time updates.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with tables for users, documents, and version history.
- **AI Integration**: LanguageTool API for grammar and style suggestions.
- **Concurrency**: Last-write-wins with version history for conflict resolution.

## Design Decisions
- **Modular Structure**: Separated routes, models, services, and sockets for scalability.
- **Simple Authentication**: Email/password with Flask-Login for security.
- **WebSockets**: Used for real-time updates to ensure low latency.
- **AI**: Lightweight LanguageTool API to avoid performance overhead.

## Challenges
- **Concurrency**: Implemented last-write-wins with version history due to time constraints; OT/CRDTs considered for future.
- **Performance**: Limited AI calls to on-demand requests to reduce latency.
- **Security**: Basic session management with Flask-Login; OAuth planned for future.

## Future Improvements
- Implement Operational Transformation for better conflict resolution.
- Add OAuth for multiple providers.
- Enhance AI with context-aware suggestions.
